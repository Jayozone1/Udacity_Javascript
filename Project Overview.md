Project Overview
Building the core functionality used for a storefront application. The visual of the storefront and the Javascript necessary to connect the code.

Breakdown
Picturing an online store, There are typically 3 parts,
1. The product listing
2. The Cart
3. The Checkout

Products 
Think of the product list. You have learned about object literals. Object are a perfect way to store Product data, and you can use an array to collect those objects.
Each product must be able to be added to the cart.

Cart
The shopping cart. Carts usually have quite a bit of functionality. Once the cart is populated with products, you need to be able to increase or decrease the quantity or fully remove an item.
The cart often displays the individual product totals and updates as the quantity changes.

Checkout
There's the checkout, For this project, assume it's a cash-only storefront at a street Market. The checkout should show the final amount due for all products in the cart. For any amount of cash received,
the receipt should show what is still owed by the customer or how much should be returned to the customer if they gave more than the total due.

When we build professional shopping carts, we almost always want to have the data stored somewhere so that we can access it later for things like accounting, inventory, and returns.
You won't have to worry about a backend at this point, but the work you do with your product objects will set you up well for future projects where you have a backend you need  to access.


The Results!!!
After completing the functionality for your shopping cart, the resulting storefront will look like this:
